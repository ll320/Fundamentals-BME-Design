# Finger Tremor Counter
## BME 590: Fund. Engineering Design (Fall 2017)

## Summary
The goal of your lab skills project is to design and build a non-contact finger
tremor detection device that will count the number of times a finger crosses an
optical beam when a patient’s hand is extended.  The device will count the
number of finger crossings, up to a maximum of 15 crossings, and will have a
reset button to reset the counter.  The count will be displayed as a 4-bit
number, as conveyed through 4 illuminated LEDs.  The device will utilize an
Arduino UNO and be enclosed in a casing that has access for a power connection,
the LEDs and power and reset buttons.  The device should not slide on a flat
desktop surface.  The device’s function should not be affected by ambient
light.

## User Story 1  
As a neurologist,  
I want to measure the rate of a patient’s finger tremor,  
So that I can assess the severity of their disease.

## User Story 2  
As a nurse,  
I want to easily see the active count of finger movements,  
So that I can easily record it in the patient’s record.

## User Story 3  
As a nurse assistant,  
I want to be able to easily start and reset the device,  
So that I  can quickly make measurements without delaying our clinical workflow.
